### Hi there 👋

- ☕  I'm working as a Tech Lead for [@newscorpaus](https://github.com/newscorpaus) with [VIP Enterprise WordPress](https://wpvip.com/) since January 2020
- 🌱 I'm currently learning anything WordPress related: **Gutenberg**, **Blocks** and **React**
- 👯 I'm looking to collaborate on **open source projects**, preferably with **PHP** and **WordPress**
- 📫 Find me on [![LinkedIn: freibergergarcia](https://img.shields.io/badge/-freibergergarcia-blue?style=flat&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white&link=https://www.linkedin.com/in/freibergergarcia/)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/freibergergarcia/)


#### fyi
- Most of my work is under private repositories and a different GitHub handle ([@freibergerb](https://github.com/freibergerb)), so you can't see a lot here ⏳
- My only couple of **open source** contributions were under [@freibergerb](https://github.com/freibergerb) for [GoogleForCreators/web-stories-wp](https://github.com/GoogleForCreators/web-stories-wp) while working on a [@newscorpaus](https://github.com/newscorpaus) project:
  - [#10005](https://github.com/GoogleForCreators/web-stories-wp/pull/10005) 
  - [#12647](https://github.com/GoogleForCreators/web-stories-wp/pull/12647)
